**M2: Bioorthogonal Chemistry for Biology and Medicine**
<br> *Michaelmas Term 2025 (6 lectures)*
<br> *Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge, UK*

<div style="text-align: justify"> In this course we introduce bioorthogonal chemistry: reactions that form or cleave bonds inside living cells without disturbing native biology. We explore bond-forming ligations for precise labelling, imaging, and capture, alongside bond-cleavage strategies that unlock function on demand, enabling controlled activation of probes and therapeutics with spatial and temporal precision. Emphasis will be on practical design principles such as chemoselectivity, kinetics at low concentration, handle stability and biocompatibility, and how these govern success in real biological settings. We will also connect to enabling platforms to illustrate how chemistry can be programmed to ask and answer pressing questions in living cells. </div>

This course was designed and taught for Part III (Dept of Chemistry, Cambridge) by Unnikrishnan V. B

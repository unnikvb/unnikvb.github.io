<div style="text-align: justify"> At the nexus of chemistry and biology, the field of chemical biology has revolutionised our ability to comprehend and influence biological systems. Central to this revolution is the development of <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/uploads/2022/10/advanced-chemistryprize2022-2.pdf" bioorthogonal transformations </a>, designed to function independently of the endogenous processes within living organisms. Judicious application of such chemical principles has opened new avenues to probe and control complex biological phenomena, driving forward our capabilities in research and therapeutic development. This journey into the molecular depths of life is reshaping the landscape of scientific pursuit, signalling the dawn of a new era in biological research and medical breakthroughs. <br>
<br>
We currently aim to convert finely tuned molecular reactivity into practical tools that switch medicines “on” only where they’re needed,
illuminate hidden biology in real time, and inspire entirely new therapy concepts.
